# Wine-Quality-Analysis-and-Prediciton

### Project Summary
Wine industry has shown growth over the years due to interest and increase in wine consumption. Analyzing wine quality is important to preserve human health. Evaluating wine quality manually will be a time-consuming process as there many chemical properties have to be assessed like pH level, acidity. The process can be expensive due to various tests that needs to be performed. 
Hence, this project is to predict quality of wine by analyzing various attributes from wine data. The data will be cleaned and exploratory data analysis will be performed. The features that correlate to best wine quality will be analyzed. Data will be split into train and test data and machine learning models like Random Forest will be used. The model with best result will be tuned to improve accuracy and efficiency.
